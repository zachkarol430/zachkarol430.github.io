Here are some of national parks I have been to. I plan on adding to this in near future as a visit more parks

## Acadia
{% include carousel.html height="70" unit="%" duration="100000" number= "1" %}

These were taken in 2018. Pretty awesome national park! This park was a lot of fun and a lot of short trails. 

## Cuyahoga
{% include carousel_small.html height="70" unit="%" duration="100000" number="2" %}

In all honestly was quite a boring national park. The waterfalls were worth seeing, but everything else was pretty generic. The highway can be easily seen from somes trails and this park did not feel remote.

## Indiana sand dunes
{% include carousel_small.html height="55" unit="%" duration="100000" number="3" %}

Again a mediocre national park. I would honestly skip this park unless you want to just see a regular beach. 

## Badlands 
{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" duration="100000" number="4" %}

Amazing national park. One of my favorites. Highly recommend Sage Creek Campground. This park was the most unique thing I have ever seen and the contrast between the plains and the badlands is insane.

## Yellowstone
{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" duration="100000" number="5" %}

spectacular national park. I wish I spent more time there. I will be back soon. This park has everything. Hiking, cool natural features, and plently of animals. Go early as the park gets busy really quickly. 

## Grand Teton
{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" duration="100000" number="6" %}

Another amazing national park. Really good hiking. I recommend delta lake hike. It was tough but worth it. 

## Canyonland
{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" duration="100000" number="7" %}

Pretty great. Had low expectations, but it ended up being amazing. This park was very bare bones, but the views were spectacular

## Arches
{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" duration="100000" number="8" %}

Was not there for a long time, but was pretty cool. I am in the middle in the third picture. The whole park can easily be seen in a day.
