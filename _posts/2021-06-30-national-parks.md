Here are some of national parks I have been to. I plan on adding to this in near future as a visit more parks

## Acadia
{% include carousel.html height="70" unit="%" duration="100000" number= "1" %}

These were taken in 2018. Pretty awesome national park!

## Cuyahoga
{% include carousel_small.html height="70" unit="%" duration="100000" number="2" %}

In all honestly was quite a boring national park

## Indiana sand dunes
{% include carousel_small.html height="55" unit="%" duration="100000" number="3" %}

Again a mediocre national park

## Badlands 
{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" duration="100000" number="4" %}

Amazing national park. One of my favorites. Highly recommend Sage Creek Campground. 

## Yellowstone
{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" duration="100000" number="5" %}

Again an amazing national park. I wish I spent more time there. I will be back soon.

## Grand Teton
{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" duration="100000" number="6" %}

Another amazing national park. Really good hiking.

## Canyonland
{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" duration="100000" number="7" %}

Pretty great. Had low expectations, but it ended up being amazing

## Arches
{% include carousel.html height="80" unit="%" duration="100000" number="8" %}

Was not there for a long time, but was pretty cool. I am in the middle in the third picture.
