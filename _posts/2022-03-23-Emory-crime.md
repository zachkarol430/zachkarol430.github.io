## Crime project

I have used selenium to get all of Emorys crime data. This crime data is stored in a csv on my computer but I plan on storing this with AWS and constantly update the data. I am still working on this project but here is a map I have made of Emory's crime. This is still a work in progress but leave any comments or ideas below!
