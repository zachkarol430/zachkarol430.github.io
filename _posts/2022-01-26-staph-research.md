## Staph Research

For the past couple of months I have been research the staph genome. Mostly just doing explatory work and realizing detecting horizontal gene transfer is hard. I am using [Staphopia](https://github.com/staphopia/staphopia-r) as a tool which has thousands of public staph genomes. 

Currently looking at how staph genes accessory(not all staph have these genes) staph genes can relate to core genome(genes all staph samples have)

I will be uploading a new github repository with my machine learning model for sequence type, if I can make sure it makes sense. Stay tuned!
